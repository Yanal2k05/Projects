## Project Overview
This assignment is about a program that processes a graph represented as an adjacency matrix stored in a text file. The program offers a menu with options to display the graph as an adjacency list, perform BFS and DFS starting from vertex 1, find shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm. The goal is to implement and interact with key graph algorithms while understanding graph representation and menu-driven programming in C.

## Test cases
I made an autograder with with different graphs and error handlings

## Resources 
I used zybook, youtube, geeksforgeeks
