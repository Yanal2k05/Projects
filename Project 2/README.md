## Assignment Overview
The assignment involves implementing two C programs: one to convert a fully parenthesized arithmetic expression into a binary expression tree and 
perform various tree traversals, calculations with error handling), and another to build a max-heap from a file containing integers, using a 2D array representation. 

## Test cases
I found a autograder on github, it didn't work for me so I modified it and then it finally worked,
I passed all the test cases however I didn't have one for the error handlings so I modified it further and added invalid test cases and I passed them too
