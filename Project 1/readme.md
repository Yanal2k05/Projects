## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about? Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.

Car Rental Management: This program manages cars in three lists—available, rented, and in-repair. You can add, return, transfer, or rent cars while checking for valid inputs (like mileage and plate numbers). It also calculates rental charges for returned cars and saves the data to files. It ensures data integrity by checking for valid inputs (e.g., mileage, plate, etc) 

RPN This program evaluates postfix mathematical expressions (RPN) using a linked-list-based stack. It takes an expression from the command line and computes the result, ensuring that errors (like invalid input) are properly handled.


## Resources 
Did you use any resources (for example book, notes etc) in this assignment?
I used zybook and the lecture slides

## Implementation
I've completed the assignment, but I’m really confused by the mismatch between your instructions and the provided array. You said we can input a maximum of 8 characters, but the array allows only 6, which is causing a segmentation fault. This has been really frustrating
