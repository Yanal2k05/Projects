## Project Overview
What is the Project about? Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.

Car Rental Management: This program manages cars in three listsâ€”available, rented, and in-repair. You can add, return, transfer, or rent cars while checking for valid inputs (like mileage and plate numbers). It also calculates rental charges for returned cars and saves the data to files. It ensures data integrity by checking for valid inputs (e.g., mileage, plate, etc) 

RPN This program evaluates postfix mathematical expressions (RPN) using a linked-list-based stack. It takes an expression from the command line and computes the result, ensuring that errors (like invalid input) are properly handled.
